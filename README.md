###  Project 1 : Time Series forecasting
Time Series forecasting is a very important technique used in the demand planning process. Predicting future demand is one of the most valuable activities the organizations can undertake. A demand planâ€™s impact is felt throughout the business, from sales and marketing to manufacturing and distribution. When forecasting models are built correctly, demand planning can position the company in a great position to deliver superior customer service while meeting their financial objectives.
Blow is a project to display its capabilities using Tableau's SuperStore dataset. It gives an understanding into model selection evaluation and forecasting into the future.

###  Project 3 : Procurement optimization

This project focusus on the application of discrete optimization on procurement function the example looks at frieght procurement. This model can be extended in procureing any services or products. The optimization is run on Excel with a new Python based solver which can manage a lot more decision variables.
We also look into to the process of decision making which running these models.
